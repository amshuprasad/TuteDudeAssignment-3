# Math Operations and Factorial Calculator

This Python program performs two main tasks:
1. **Performs mathematical calculations using the `math` module**:
    - Square root
    - Natural logarithm
    - Sine (in radians)
2. **Calculates the factorial of a number using a loop**

## ðŸ“Œ Features

### 1. **Math Calculations**

- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The program uses the `math` module to compute:
  - **Square root** using `math.sqrt()`
  - **Natural logarithm (base e)** using `math.log()`
  - **Sine of the number in radians** using `math.sin()`
- The results are displayed in a clean, readable format.

### 2. **Factorial Calculation**

- The user is asked to input another number.
- A custom function named `factorial()` is defined using a `for` loop.
- This function multiplies numbers from 1 up to the given input to compute the factorial.
- The result is printed with a clear message.
